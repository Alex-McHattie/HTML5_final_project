	I tried every
	way in the book (pp. 
	414-5) and per Eric's 
	instructions to make a 
	FAVICON, AND every 
	other 
	way I could think of, 
	including attempting to 
	COMMANDEER the Murach 
	ico file and re do it, 
	but...
	my Mac REFUSES to make 
	an ico OR 
	EVEN a mac version 
	(ICNS), Infran View 
	doesn't do 
	anything, and FavIcon 
	from Pics doesn't offer a 
	conversion to ico... 
	despite Murach's 
	suggestion... 
	in fact, NONE of the 
	quote FREE unquote 
	options 
	work!!! 
	
	I got images in the 
	file, I can easily crop 
	them 
	to 16x16 pixels no 
	problem, but I cannot 
	make it 
	take an ICO or even an 
	ICNS extension. -->
	
	
	<!-- WED AUGUST 5
	per Eric's help, Alex 
	finally found a way
	to commandeer an ICO file 
	and make ALEX's own 
	Favicon, complete 
	with ICO extension -->
	
	<!-- BUT WAIT... Alex 
	then discovered Alex 
	could take an image

		<br>
		<blockquote lang="ru"><strong>Лицо его было как Солнце — в тот час когда Солнце в зените,<br>
		Глаза его были как звёзды — пред тем как сорваться с Небес,<br>
		И краски из радуг служили как ткани, узоры, и нити,<br>
		Для пышных его одеяний, в которых он снова воскрес.</strong></blockquote>
		<br>
		<blockquote>&ldquo;His face was like the Sun - at that hour when the Sun is at its zenith,<br>
		His eyes were like stars - before falling from Heaven,<br>
		And rainbow paints served as fabrics, patterns, and threads,<br>
		For his magnificent robes, in which he was resurrected again.&rdquo;</blockquote>
